            <li>4 cups water, more as needed</li>
            <li>1 large carrot, peeled and cut into chunks</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Put the chicken pieces in a medium saucepan with just enough water to cover. Cover and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Drain the water. Rinse the chicken under water to get rid of any impurities.</li>
            <li>Fill a medium soup pot with 4 cups of water. Add the prepared chicken, cover, and bring to a boil over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Once the water boils, remove any impurities from the surface with a ladle. Adjust the heat to low.</li>
            <li>Add the carrots, onion and peppercorn. Simmer on very low heat for 1 and a half hours.</li>
            <li>Add the potatoes to the soup. Continue to simmer till the chicken is cooked through and the carrots and potatoes are tender.
                This should take about 2 and a half hours.

            <li>Add salt to taste, and serve.</li>
