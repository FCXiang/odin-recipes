        <h2>Spaghetti Aglio Oglio</h2>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Ingredient List</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Half a handful of spaghetti of your choice</li>
            <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Chili flakes or peppercino</li>
            <li>4-10 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>It's good to be prepared before you start cooking. Peel your garlic and the amount of spaghetti you'll be eating.</li>
            <li>Fill up a pot of water and throw your spaghetti in. Season the water generously. Traditionally they say to season it till the water is "as salty as the ocean", but if you've never tasted ocean water before then just toss in about 3 large pinches of salt.</li>
            <li>Boil the pot of water till the spaghetti is short of al-dente. This takes about 15 - 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the pot is boiling, slice your garlic into thin slices. Traditionally they add 4-8 cloves of garlic, but it's up to you how garlicky you want your spaghetti to be.</li>
            <li>Coat your pan with olive oil. Heat the pan in low-medium heat.</li>
            <li>Saute the garlic and chili flakes till the garlic is a light golden colour.</li>
            <li>Immediately toss your pasta into the pan. Stir vigorously to coat the pasta in the olive oil. Do this till the pasta is al-dente. If the sauce looks too thin, add a bit of pasta water to the pan.</li>
            <li>Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve</li>
        </ol>
